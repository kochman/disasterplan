# safetynet

## Requirements

Ensure these are installed before continuing.

- [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org) or Python 3.6
- [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org)

## Getting started

safetynet is written in Python. To run safetynet for development:

### Installing

```
git clone git@github.com:kochman/safetynet.git
cd safetynet
pipenv install --three
```

### Running

```
pipenv shell
python app.py
```

## API endpoints

- GET `/api/profiles`:

    Returns a JSON list of profiles that safetynet thinks this user is interested in. Right now, that's every profile, but eventually will be location-based.

- POST `/api/profiles`:

    Create a new profile. The body should be a JSON object similar to the following:

    ```
    {
        "name": "Safetynet User",
        "latitude": 42.733011,
        "longitude": -73.667795,
        "status": "A freeform text field for users to provide information..."
    }
    ```

- POST `/api/profiles/<id>`:

    Update an existing profile with a specific ID. This endpoint expects an object with two fields, i.e.:

    ```
    {
        "profile": <profile object>,
        "token": <token returned from `/api/profiles`>
    }
    ```

    This will only succeed if the token matches the one generated by POSTing to `/api/profiles`.
